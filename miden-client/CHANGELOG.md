# Changelog

## 0.15.0 (TBD)

### Changes

* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient::get_block_by_number()` now takes an `include_proof: bool` parameter to control whether the block proof is included in the response. ([#1991](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1991))
* [BREAKING][param][rust] `NodeRpcClient::sync_chain_mmr()` replaced `block_to: Option<BlockNumber>` with `upper_bound: SyncTarget` to match the RPC definition. Use `SyncTarget::CommittedChainTip` for previous default behavior (`None`), or `SyncTarget::BlockNumber(num)` for a specific block number. ([#1991](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1991))
* [BREAKING][rust] Added `submit_proven_batch` to `NodeRpcClient` trait. ([#2075](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2075))

### Enhancements

* Made new-account construction use merged storage schema commitment (`build_with_schema_commitment`), re-exported `AccountBuilderSchemaCommitmentExt`, added WASM `buildWithoutSchemaCommitment()`, and fixed contract `accounts.create()` to require explicit `components` ([#1996](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1996)).
* Fixed the faucet token symbol display when showing account details ([#1985](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1985)).
* [FEATURE][rust,cli,web] Added `get_network_note_status` to `NodeRpcClient` trait for querying the processing status of notes submitted to the network (pending, nullifier-inflight, discarded, nullifier-committed), along with attempt count and error details. Exposed as `miden-client network-note-status <note_id>` CLI command and `RpcClient.getNetworkNoteStatus()` in the web client. ([#1981](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1981))
* Added `miden-cli call` command for invoking account procedures directly from the CLI.
* Made `TransactionStoreUpdate` serialization lossless ([#2112](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2112)).

## 0.14.4 (TBA)

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] Added `"custom"` operation to `preview()` so users can dry-run any pre-built `TransactionRequest`, not just send/mint/consume/swap ([#2052](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2052)).

## 0.14.3 (2026-04-16)

### Fixes

* [FIX] Detect notes created and consumed on the same block that got erased from the node and mark them as consumed ([#2008](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2008)).

## 0.14.2 (2026-04-15)

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] Added `compile.noteScript({ code, libraries? })` to `MidenClient`, filling the gap left on the resource-based surface for note-script compilation. Mirrors the existing `compile.txScript` shape ([#2044](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2044)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exported the `CompilerResource` class so framework wrappers (e.g. React hooks) can instantiate the compile surface over a `WasmWebClient` proxy without wrapping the full `MidenClient`. The third constructor argument is now optional ([#2044](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2044)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Fixed `syncState` deterministically failing with `mmr peaks are invalid: number of one bits in leaves is N which does not equal peak length M` after importing a private note whose inclusion block pre-dates the wallet's current sync height. `get_and_store_authenticated_block` was overwriting the correct historical peaks (written by `applyStateSync`) with peaks from the caller's current `PartialMmr` forest, so subsequent reads at the same block hit the `InvalidPeaks` validation. The IndexedDB `insertBlockHeader` now uses add-if-not-exists semantics, matching the SQLite store's `INSERT OR IGNORE` in `insert_block_header_tx` ([#2039](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2039)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed WASM worker loading under webpack 5 / Next.js consumers. v0.14.1's single classic worker rewrote `import.meta.url` → `self.location.href` (needed for Safari/WKWebView cold-start performance), which webpack's asset tracer cannot follow — consumers hit a 404 on `miden_client_web.wasm` and the SDK silently fell back to a main-thread mode that hung on `sync()`. The SDK now ships BOTH variants (`web-client-methods-worker.js` classic for Safari, `web-client-methods-worker.module.js` ES module for webpack/Vite/Parcel) and `WebClient` picks at runtime via UA detection, configurable via the new `WebClient.workerMode` (`"auto"` / `"module"` / `"classic"`) static. No consumer config changes needed for auto ([#2046](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/2046)).

## 0.14.1 (2026-04-14)

### Enhancements

* Optimized `get_account_details` so it only fetches the delta of large public accounts when syncing ([#1916](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1916)).

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Fixed `syncState` failure ("inconsistent partial mmr: tracked leaf at position N has no value in nodes") caused by skipping authentication node collection for blocks already tracked from the MMR delta during large catch-up syncs. Authentication nodes are now always collected for note-relevant blocks regardless of prior tracking state. ([#1997](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1997)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed `transactions.send({ returnNote: true })` throwing `expected instance of NoteArray`. The JS wrapper was still building `OutputNoteArray` after the WASM binding for `withOwnOutputNotes` switched to `NoteArray` ([#2011](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/2011)).
* [FIX][rust] Fixed `FilesystemKeyStore::add_key` failing on Linux when the system temp dir is on a different filesystem than the keys directory ([#2009](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2009)).
* [FIX][rust] Made source manager handling consistent when building transaction scripts. The empty fallback script is now compiled against the client's source manager instead of a fresh one, so any source information on the produced `TransactionScript` is registered with the same source manager used by the executor ([#2006](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/2006)).

## 0.14.0 (2026-04-07)

### Enhancements

* [FEATURE][web] Added `StorageView` JS wrapper over WASM `AccountStorage`. `account.storage()` now returns a `StorageView` that makes `getItem()` work intuitively for both Value and StorageMap slots. WASM primitives are unchanged; the raw `AccountStorage` is accessible via `.raw` ([#1955](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1955)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `wordToBigInt()` utility export for losslessly converting a `Word`'s first felt to a `BigInt`. `StorageResult.toString()` is BigInt-backed, and `valueOf()` returns a JS number for values fitting in `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and throws `RangeError` for larger u64 values — use `.toBigInt()` for exact access ([#1955](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1955)).
* Made `GrpcNoteTransportClient` connection lazy, deferring it to the first RPC call instead of connecting eagerly at client initialization ([#1970](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1970)).
* Updated the `GrpcClient` to fetch the RPC limits from the node ([#1724](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1724)) ([#1737](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1737), [#1809](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1809)).
* Added typed error parsing for node RPC endpoints, enabling programmatic error handling instead of string parsing ([#1734](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1734)).
* Added `--rpc-status` flag to `miden-client info` command to display RPC node status information including node version, genesis commitment, store status, and block producer status; also added `get_status_unversioned` to `NodeRpcClient` trait ([#1742](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1742)).
* Prevent a potential unwrap panic in `insert_storage_map_nodes_for_map` ([#1750](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1750)).
* Changed the `StateSync::sync_state()` to take a reference of the MMR ([#1764](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1764)).
* Account storage restructured into latest/historical tables for efficient delta writes and simpler pruning ([#1775](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1775)).
* Remove unnecessary clones of `NoteInclusionProof` and `NoteMetadata` in note import and sync paths ([#1787](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1787)).
* [FEATURE][web] WebClient now automatically syncs state before account creation when the client has never been synced, preventing a slow full-chain scan on the next sync (#1704).
* Added `NoteScreener` constructor via `Client::note_screener()` and improved note consumability checks with batch note screening support ([#1803](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1803), [#1814](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1814)).
* [FEATURE][web] Added `getAccountProof` method to the web client's `RpcClient`, allowing lightweight retrieval of account header, storage slot values, and code via a single RPC call. Refactored the `NodeRpcClient::get_account_proof` signature to allow requesting just private account proofs ([#1794](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1794), [#1814](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1814)).
* Added `getAccountByKeyCommitment` method to `WebClient` for retrieving accounts by public key commitment ([#1729](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1729)).
* [BREAKING][removal][web] Removed `addAccountSecretKeyToWebStore`, `getAccountAuthByPubKeyCommitment`, `getPublicKeyCommitmentsOfAccount`, and `getAccountByKeyCommitment` from `WebClient`. Use the new `client.keystore` sub-object instead (e.g. `client.keystore.insert()`, `client.keystore.get()`, `client.keystore.getCommitments()`, `client.keystore.getAccountId()` + `client.getAccount()`). ([#1947](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1947)).
* Added automatic registration of note scripts required by network transactions (NTX). The client now checks the node's script registry before submitting a transaction and registers any missing scripts via a separate registration transaction ([#1840](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1840)).
* Added automatic retry for rate-limited (`ResourceExhausted`) and transiently unavailable RPC calls in `GrpcClient`, with up to 5 attempts and `retry-after` header support ([#1928](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1928)).
* Added client methods to prune account history (commitments of previous nonces, alongside its orphaned account code) ([#1886](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1886)).
* Changed the sync state to track the consumer account on externally-consumed notes, so the `InputNoteReader` can return notes even if the transaction was not locally executed ([#1973](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1973)).

### Changes

* [BREAKING] Incremented MSRV to 1.91([#1798](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1798)).
* [BREAKING] Replaced `AuthFalcon512Rpo`/`AuthEcdsaK256Keccak` with unified  `AuthSingleSig`, changed `StorageMapKey` from a type alias to a newtype, renamed note constructors to associated methods (`P2idNote::create`, `SwapNote::create`, `P2ideNote::create`), and started requiring `AccountComponentMetadata` in `AccountComponent::new`([#1798](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1798)).
* Included Partial states in `NoteFilter::Unspent` for output notes ([#1817](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1817)).
* [BREAKING][arch][web] Replaced the `WebClient` class with a new `MidenClient` resource-based API as the primary web SDK entry point. `WebClient` is still available as `WasmWebClient` for low-level access but is no longer part of the public API. All documentation has been updated to use `MidenClient`. Migration: replace `WebClient.createClient(rpcUrl, noteTransportUrl, seed, storeName)` with `MidenClient.create({ rpcUrl, noteTransportUrl, seed, storeName })`, and replace direct method calls (e.g. `client.newWallet(...)`, `client.submitNewTransaction(...)`, `client.getAccounts()`) with resource methods (e.g. `client.accounts.create()`, `client.transactions.send(...)`, `client.accounts.list()`). ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1762)).
* [BREAKING][type][web] `AccountId.fromHex()` now returns `Result` (throws on invalid hex) instead of silently panicking via `unwrap()`. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1762)).
* [BREAKING] Added a `AccountReader` accessible through `Client::account_reader` to read account data without needing to load the whole `Account` ([#1713](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1713), [#1716](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1716)).
* [BREAKING] Added `Keystore` trait that extends `TransactionAuthenticator` to provide a unified interface for key storage, retrieval, and account-key mapping, enabling custom keystore implementations. `Keystore` replaces `TransactionAuthenticator` in `Client` and provides a way to map from account IDs to public keys (registering them separately is not required anymore). ([#1726](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1726)).
* Refactored integration tests binary with subprocess-per-test execution; added automatic retry of failed tests (`--retry-count`), captured stdout/stderr per test, and tracing support via `RUST_LOG` ([#1743](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1743)).
* Improved integration test logging with a `--verbose` flag for info-level tracing, routed tracing output to stderr to avoid corrupting subprocess JSON, and added `tracing::info!` instrumentation to test helpers ([#1816](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1816)).
* Added implementation for the `get_public_key` method on the `FilesystemKeystore` and `WebKeystore` ([#1731](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1731)).
* [BREAKING] Made the nullifiers sync optional on the `StateSync` component ([#1756](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1756)).
* Decoupled keystore functionality from `WebStore` by moving keystore helper logic from `idxdb-store` into the `web-client` crate, also added `export_store` and `import_store` methods to the `Store` trait, enabling usage of different stores ([#1795](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1795)).
* [BREAKING] Added `SyncStateInputs` to bundle the parameters needed to perform the sync state ([#1778](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1778)).
* Added lazy loading for foreign accounts. Specifying `TransactionRequestBuilder::foreign_accounts()` for public accounts is no longer required ([#1812](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1812), [#1892](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1892)).
* [BREAKING][type][web] `AuthSecretKey.getRpoFalcon512SecretKeyAsFelts()` and `getEcdsaK256KeccakSecretKeyAsFelts()` now return `Result<Vec<Felt>, JsValue>` instead of panicking on key type mismatch ([#1833](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1833)).
* [BREAKING][rename][cli] Renamed `CliConfig::from_system()` to `CliConfig::load()` and `CliClient::from_system_user_config()` to `CliClient::new()` for better discoverability ([#1848](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1848)).
* Removed `SmtForest` empty-root workaround in `AccountSmtForest::safe_pop_smts`, now that the upstream fix has landed in miden-crypto v0.19.7 ([#1864](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1864)).
* [BREAKING][rename][all] Adapted to upstream protocol renames: `Falcon512Rpo` renamed to `Falcon512Poseidon2`, `Felt::as_int()` renamed to `as_canonical_u64()`, `OutputNote::Full` replaced by `OutputNote::Public(PublicOutputNote)`, Asset now uses key-value words API.
* [BREAKING][rename][all] Adapted to upstream protocol 0.14.0 renames: `NoteHeader::commitment()` renamed to `to_commitment()`, `NoteLocation::node_index_in_block()` renamed to `block_note_tree_index()`, `StorageMapKey::inner()` removed (use `Word::from(key)`), `TransactionOutputs::expiration_block_num` field now private (use getter). ([#1926](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1926))
* Added an `InputNoteReader` accessible through `client.input_note_reader()` that allows for lazy iterator over all the consumed input notes ([#1843](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1843), ([#1925](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1925))).
* Removed miden-cli template TOMLs in favor of direct serialization into packages ([#1879](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1879)).
* [BREAKING] Updated `SyncState` to fetch multiple note updates ([#1941](https://github.com/0xMiden/node/pull/1941), [#1963](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1963)).
* Unified test environment variables across Rust and web client test suites. `TEST_MIDEN_NETWORK` now acts as a preset that configures all components (RPC, prover, note transport) for `devnet`/`testnet`/`localhost`. Individual env vars (`TEST_MIDEN_RPC_URL`, `TEST_MIDEN_PROVER_URL`, `TEST_MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_URL`) override specific components. Removed `TEST_MIDEN_RPC_ENDPOINT`, `TEST_WITH_NOTE_TRANSPORT`, `TEST_MIDEN_NOTE_TRANSPORT_ENDPOINT`, and `REMOTE_PROVER` ([#1939](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1939)).
* [BREAKING] Updated miden-node crates to v0.14.3 and adapted to upstream package-related changes: `MastArtifact` and `PackageKind` removed, `Package::mast` is now `Arc<Library>`, `PackageManifest::new()` returns `Result`, `assemble_library()` returns `Arc<Library>`([#1972](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1972)).

### Features

* [FEATURE][web] New `MidenClient` class with resource-based API (`client.accounts`, `client.transactions`, `client.notes`, `client.tags`, `client.settings`). Provides high-level transaction helpers (`send`, `mint`, `consume`, `swap`, `consumeAll`), transaction dry-runs via `preview()`, confirmation polling via `waitFor()`, and flexible account/note references that accept hex strings, bech32 strings, or WASM objects interchangeably (`AccountRef`, `NoteInput` types). Factory methods: `MidenClient.create()`, `MidenClient.createTestnet()`, `MidenClient.createMock()`. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `TransactionId.fromHex()` static constructor for creating transaction IDs from hex strings. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] Added standalone tree-shakeable note utilities (`createP2IDNote`, `createP2IDENote`, `buildSwapTag`) usable without a client instance. ([#1762](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1762))
* [FEATURE][web] SDK ergonomics: `accounts.getOrImport(ref)` convenience method, `accounts.import()` accepts full `AccountRef`, `transactions.send()` return type changed to `SendResult` with optional `returnNote`, notes API simplified (`listAvailable` returns `InputNoteRecord[]`, `consume` accepts `Note` objects), `MidenClient.create()` accepts rpcUrl/proverUrl shorthands.
* [BREAKING][FEATURE][web] Custom contract support: `accounts.create()` with `ImmutableContract`/`MutableContract` types, new `client.compile` resource (`compile.component()`, `compile.txScript()` with `"dynamic"`/`"static"` linking), and `transactions.execute({ account, script, foreignAccounts? })` for custom script execution with FPI. `transactions.send()` return type changed. ([#1828](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1828))
* [FEATURE][web] Account import improvements: `accounts.getOrImport(ref)` convenience method, and `accounts.import()` now accepts full `AccountRef` (string, `AccountId`, `Account`, `AccountHeader`) in addition to `{ file }` and `{ seed }` forms. ([#1828](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1828))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `AccountId.fromPrefixSuffix(prefix, suffix)` constructor for building an `AccountId` from its two felt components, useful when prefix/suffix are stored separately in storage maps. ([#1889](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1889))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `TransactionRequestBuilder.withExpirationDelta()` for expiring manual transaction requests ([#1904](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1904))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `accounts.insert({ account, overwrite? })` to `MidenClient` for inserting pre-built `Account` objects into the local store. Enables external signer integrations that build accounts via `AccountBuilder` with custom auth commitments ([#1922](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1922)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `executeProgram` (view call) to the JS side, allowing local execution of a transaction script against an account and inspection of the 16-element stack output without submitting to the network. Added `AdviceInputs` constructor and reverse `From` conversions. ([#1859](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/issues/1859))
* [FEATURE][web] Added `client.keystore` sub-object API for managing secret keys. Methods: `insert(accountId, secretKey)`, `get(pubKeyCommitment)`, `remove(pubKeyCommitment)`, `getCommitments(accountId)`, `getAccountId(pubKeyCommitment)`. Also available on `MidenClient` as a resource (`client.keystore`). ([#1947](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1947))

### Fixes

* [FIX][web] Replaced `.unwrap()` panics with proper `Result` returns in `MerklePath.computeRoot()`, `NoteExecutionHint.fromParts()`, `NoteExecutionHint.canBeConsumed()`, `NoteStorage` constructor, and `TransactionStatus.discarded()` WASM bindings ([#1870](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1870)).
* [FIX][rust] Fixed `get_vault_asset_witnesses` failing with `MerkleError::RootNotInStore` when the vault root is missing from the `AccountSmtForest`. The error is now caught and falls back to loading the full vault from the store ([#1890](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1890)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed the error `TypeError: parameter 1 is not of type 'ArrayBuffer'` when re-initializing a client with an imported database. `Uint8Array` fields (e.g. the client version setting) were exported as plain arrays and not restored to `Uint8Array` on import, causing `TextDecoder.decode()` to fail. Export now tags `Uint8Array` values for correct round-trip. ([#1952](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1952))
* [FIX][rust] Replaced `.expect()` panics on RPC response data with proper error propagation ([#1833](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1833)).

## 0.13.4 (2026-03-23)

* [FIX][rust,web] Fixed storage map slots with duplicate roots losing their entries after a store round-trip, which corrupted the storage commitment ([#1915](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1915)).
* [FIX][all] Fixed private notes delivered via NTL getting stuck as `Expected` when syncing at high frequency (e.g. every 3s). The on-chain commitment could be processed before the NTL delivered the note data, causing the note to never transition to `Committed`. The note import flow now scans back up to 20 blocks from the current sync height when checking for committed notes, so notes committed just before the client synced past them are found during import.

## 0.13.3 (2026-03-16)

* [FIX][rust,web] Fixed `sync_state()` invoking the external signer (e.g. wallet extension) during note consumability checks, causing repeated confirmation popups on every sync cycle. `NoteScreener` no longer attaches the `TransactionAuthenticator` when trial-executing consume transactions; accounts requiring auth now return `ConsumableWithAuthorization` instead ([#1905](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1905)).
* [FIX][rust] Fixed redundant `/GetAccount` RPC calls during `sync_state()` — a public account active across N sync steps now triggers exactly 1 fetch instead of N ([#1876](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1876)).
* [FIX] Deduplicated storage map entries returned by the `SyncAccountStorageMaps` RPC endpoint, keeping only the latest value per key. Previously, accounts with storage map keys updated across multiple blocks would fail to load ([#1902](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1902)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed `PrematureCommitError` crash during `syncState()` by moving all IndexedDB writes into a single Dexie transaction instead of spawning competing inner transactions ([#1876](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1876)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `getAccountProof` in the `RpcClient`, accepting optional `AccountStorageRequirements` and block number parameters to fetch specific storage maps without full account reconstruction ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1917)).
* [FEATURE][web] Exposed `syncStorageMaps` in the `RpcClient` for paginated retrieval of large storage maps ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1917)).
* [FEATURE][rust] Added `storage_details()` and `find_map_details()` accessors to `AccountProof` for direct access to storage map data ([#1917](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1917)).

## 0.13.2 (2026-02-26)

* Updated to `miden-crypto` v0.19.5 ([#1813](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1813)).
* [FIX] Stopped including unnecessary storage map data when loading existing accounts for transaction execution. New accounts (nonce == 0) still get full storage maps as needed for kernel validation ([#1832](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1832)).
* [FIX][web] Added missing `attachment()` getter to `NoteMetadata` WASM binding ([#1810](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1810)).
* [FIX][web] Fixed transaction execution failures after reopening a browser extension by always persisting MMR authentication nodes during sync, even for blocks with no relevant notes. Previously, closing and reopening the extension lost in-memory MMR state and the store was missing nodes needed for Merkle authentication paths. Also surfaces a distinct `PartialBlockchainNodeNotFound` error instead of a confusing deserialization crash when nodes are missing ([#1789](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1789)).

## 0.13.1 (2026-02-13)

* Added the `@miden-sdk/react` hooks library (see [its own changelog](packages/react-sdk/CHANGELOG.md)) ([#1711](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1711)).
* Fixed WASM bindings consuming JS objects: `RpcClient` and `WebClient` methods now take references (`&AccountId`, `&Word`) instead of owned values, so callers can reuse objects after passing them ([#1765](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1765)).

//! Defines the storage interfaces used by the Miden client.
//!
//! It provides mechanisms for persisting and retrieving data, such as account states, transaction
//! history, block headers, notes, and MMR nodes.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The storage module is central to the Miden client’s persistence layer. It defines the
//! [`Store`] trait which abstracts over any concrete storage implementation. The trait exposes
//! methods to (among others):
//!
//! - Retrieve and update transactions, notes, and accounts.
//! - Store and query block headers along with MMR peaks and authentication nodes.
//! - Manage note tags for synchronizing with the node.
//!
//! These are all used by the Miden client to provide transaction execution in the correct contexts.
//!
//! In addition to the main [`Store`] trait, the module provides types for filtering queries, such
//! as [`TransactionFilter`], [`NoteFilter`], `StorageFilter` to narrow down the set of returned
//! transactions, account data, or notes. For more advanced usage, see the documentation of
//! individual methods in the [`Store`] trait.

/// The [`Store`] trait exposes all methods that the client store needs in order to track the
/// current state.
///
/// All update functions are implied to be atomic. That is, if multiple entities are meant to be
/// updated as part of any single function and an error is returned during its execution, any
/// changes that might have happened up to that point need to be rolled back and discarded.
///
/// Because the [`Store`]'s ownership is shared between the executor and the client, interior
/// mutability is expected to be implemented, which is why all methods receive `&self` and
/// not `&mut self`.

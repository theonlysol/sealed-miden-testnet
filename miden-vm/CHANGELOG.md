# Changelog

## v0.23.0 (TBD)

#### Features

- Added the `miden-vm-synthetic-bench` crate for VM-level proving regression detection driven by row-count snapshots from an external producer ([#3024](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3024)).

#### Fixes
- Rejected non-syscall references to exported kernel procedures in the linker ([#2902](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/issues/2902)).
- Reverted the `MainTrace` typed row storage change that caused a large `blake3_1to1` trace-building regression ([#2949](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2949)).
- Fixed Falcon `mod_12289` remainder validation and `u64::rotr` overflow handling for rotations by `0` and `32` ([#2968](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2968)).
- Hardened SHA256 message word range checks and U32ADD/U32ADD3 carry constraints, updating recursive verifier relation digest artifacts ([#3021](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3021)).
- [BREAKING] Removed internal `_impl` precompile helpers from the core-lib API, hardened proof deserialization and debug storage errors, and added u256 regression vectors ([#3026](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3026)).
- Fixed `u256::wrapping_mul` so it preserves caller stack values below its operands ([#3071](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3071)).
- Fixed host event and advice-mutation diagnostics to point to the triggering `emit.event(...)` instruction ([#3042](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3042)).
- Fixed debug-only underflow in memory range-check trace generation when the first memory access is at `clk = 0` ([#2976](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2976)).
- Replaced unsound `ptr::read` with safe unbox in panic recovery, removing UB from potential double-drop ([#2934](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2934)).
- Library deserialization now rejects exports whose `MastNodeId` is not a procedure root, closing a silent-failure path ([#2933](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2933)).
- Reverted `InvokeKind::ProcRef` back to `InvokeKind::Exec` in `visit_mut_procref` and added an explanatory comment (#2893).
- Fixed the release dry-run publish cycle between `miden-air` and `miden-ace-codegen`, and preserved leaf-only DAG imports with explicit snapshots ([#2931](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2931)).
- Added regression coverage for the exact `max_num_continuations` continuation-stack boundary ([#2995](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2995)).
- Fixed AEAD padding handling so encrypt does not overwrite memory next to the plaintext buffer and decrypt leaves the plaintext output tail untouched ([#3008](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3008)).
- Fixed MAST compaction after debug info is cleared so compiler-generated packages do not grow ([#3044](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3044)).
- Canonicalized `PathBuf::try_from(String)` to match `TryFrom<&str>`/`FromStr`, so semantically equivalent quoted path components compare and hash consistently.

#### Changes

- [BREAKING] Refactored MAST forest serialization around fixed-layout full, stripped, and hashless sections, and bumped the MAST wire format to `0.0.3` ([#2765](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2765)).

- [BREAKING] Removed the immediate form of `adv_push` (`adv_push.N`); use N consecutive `adv_push` instructions (or `repeat.N adv_push end` for large N) instead ([#2900](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2900)).
- [BREAKING] Reduced the prove-from-trace API to post-execution trace inputs: `TraceBuildInputs` no longer carries full execution output, `prove_from_trace_sync()` takes `TraceProvingInputs`, and `ProvingOptions` no longer include `ExecutionOptions` ([#2948](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2948)).
- Redesigned the hasher chiplet to use a controller/permutation split architecture with permutation calls deduplication ([#2927](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2927)).
- Cached repeated test compilations to speed up assembler tests without changing coverage, and fixed the core library build watch path ([#3047](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3047)).

- Aligned `core_lib::math::u256` user docs with unified LE stack limb ordering (`a0/b0` on top), removing conflicting `[b7..b0, a7..a0]` notation ([#3066](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3066)).
- Added chainable `Test` builders for common test setup in `miden-utils-testing` ([#2957](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/2957)).
- Added fuzz coverage for package semantic deserialization and project parsing, loading, and assembly ([#3015](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3015)).
- Made serde opt-in for package crates, and added macro-based binary and serde roundtrip tests for Arbitrary serialization types ([#3058](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm/pull/3058)).

//! DAG IR for ACE circuit generation.
//!
//! This module lowers symbolic AIR constraints into a DAG that mirrors the
//! verifier evaluation order: constraints are folded with the composition
//! challenge, divided by the vanishing polynomial, and then compared against
//! the recomposed quotient. Auxiliary/quotient openings are provided as base
//! coordinates and merged into extension elements inside the DAG.

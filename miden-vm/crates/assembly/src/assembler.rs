// ASSEMBLER
// ================================================================================================

/// The [Assembler] produces a _Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree (MAST)_ from Miden Assembly sources,
/// as an artifact of one of three types:
///
/// * A kernel library (see [`KernelLibrary`])
/// * A library (see [`Library`])
/// * A program (see [`Program`])
///
/// Assembled artifacts can additionally reference or include code from previously assembled
/// libraries.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Depending on your needs, there are multiple ways of using the assembler, starting with the
/// type of artifact you want to produce:
///
/// * If you wish to produce an executable program, you will call [`Self::assemble_program`] with
///   the source module which contains the program entrypoint.
/// * If you wish to produce a library for use in other executables, you will call
///   [`Self::assemble_library`] with the source module(s) whose exports form the public API of the
///   library.
/// * If you wish to produce a kernel library, you will call [`Self::assemble_kernel`] with the
///   source module(s) whose exports form the public API of the kernel.
///
/// In the case where you are assembling a library or program, you also need to determine if you
/// need to specify a kernel. You will need to do so if any of your code needs to call into the
/// kernel directly.
///
/// * If a kernel is needed, you should construct an `Assembler` using [`Assembler::with_kernel`]
/// * Otherwise, you should construct an `Assembler` using [`Assembler::new`]
///
/// <div class="warning">
/// Programs compiled with an empty kernel cannot use the `syscall` instruction.
/// </div>
///
/// Lastly, you need to provide inputs to the assembler which it will use at link time to resolve
/// references to procedures which are externally-defined (i.e. not defined in any of the modules
/// provided to the `assemble_*` function you called). There are a few different ways to do this:
///
/// * If you have source code, or a [`ast::Module`], see [`Self::compile_and_statically_link`]
/// * If you need to reference procedures from a previously assembled [`Library`], but do not want
///   to include the MAST of those procedures in the assembled artifact, you want to _dynamically
///   link_ that library, see [`Self::link_dynamic_library`] for more.
/// * If you want to incorporate referenced procedures from a previously assembled [`Library`] into
///   the assembled artifact, you want to _statically link_ that library, see
///   [`Self::link_static_library`] for more.

| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| execute_constraint_evaluation_check | Executes the constraints evaluation check by evaluating an arithmetic circuit using the ACE<br />chiplet.<br /><br />The circuit description is hardcoded into the verifier using its commitment, which is computed as<br />the sequential hash of its description using Poseidon2 hasher. The circuit description,<br />containing both constants and evaluation gates description, is stored starting at<br />`ACE_CIRCUIT_STREAM_PTR` (right after the circuit inputs). The evaluation gates portion begins at<br />`ACE_CIRCUIT_PTR`. The variable part of the circuit input is stored at the contiguous memory<br />region starting at `pi_ptr`. The (variable) inputs to the circuit are laid out such that the<br />aforementioned memory regions are together contiguous with the (variable) inputs section.<br /><br />Inputs:  []<br />Outputs: []<br /> |

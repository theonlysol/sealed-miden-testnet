# Collections
Namespace `miden::core::collections` contains modules for commonly-used authenticated data structures. This includes:

- A Merkle Mountain range.
- A Sparse Merkle Tree with 64-bit keys.
- A Sparse Merkle Tree with 256-bit keys.

## Merkle Mountain Range
Module `miden::core::collections::mmr` contains procedures for manipulating [Merkle Mountain Range](https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-server/blob/master/doc/merkle-mountain-range.md) data structure which can be used as an append-only log.

The following procedures are available to read data from and make updates to a Merkle Mountain Range.

| Procedure   | Description   |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| get         | Loads the leaf at the absolute position `pos` in the MMR onto the stack. Valid range for `pos` is between $0$ and $2^{32} - 1$ (both inclusive). Inputs: `[pos, mmr_ptr, ...]`. Output: `[N, ...]`. Where `N` is the leaf loaded from the MMR whose memory location starts at `mmr_ptr`. |
| add         | Adds a new leaf to the MMR. This will update the MMR peaks in the VM's memory and the advice provider with any merged nodes. Inputs: `[N, mmr_ptr, ...]`. Outputs: `[...]`. Where `N` is the leaf added to the MMR whose memory locations starts at `mmr_ptr`. |
| pack        | Computes a commitment to the given MMR and copies the MMR to the Advice Map using the commitment as a key. Inputs: `[mmr_ptr, ...]`. Outputs: `[HASH, ...]`. |
| unpack      | Writes the MMR who's peaks hash to `HASH` to the memory location pointed to by `mmr_ptr`. Inputs: `[HASH, mmr_ptr, ...]`. Outputs: `[...]`. Where: `HASH` is the MMR peak hash, the hash is expected to be padded to an even length and to have a minimum size of 16 elements. The advice map must contain a key with `HASH`, and its value is `[num_leaves, 0, 0, 0] \|\| hash_data`, and hash_data is the data used to computed `HASH`. `mmr_ptr` is the memory location where the MMR data will be written, starting with the MMR forest (the total count of its leaves) followed by its peaks. The memory location must be word-aligned. |

`mmr_ptr` is a pointer to the `mmr` data structure, which is defined as:
1. `mmr_ptr[0]` contains the number of leaves in the MMR
2. `mmr_ptr[1..4]` are padding and are ignored
3. `mmr_ptr[4..8], mmr_ptr[8..12], ...` contain the 1st MMR peak, 2nd MMR peak, etc.

## Sparse Merkle Tree

Module `miden::core::collections::smt` contains procedures for manipulating key-value maps with 4-element keys and 4-element values. The underlying implementation is a Sparse Merkle Tree where leaves can exist only at depth 64. Initially, when a tree is empty, it is equivalent to an empty Sparse Merkle Tree of depth 64 (i.e., leaves at depth 64 are set and hash to [ZERO; 4]). When inserting non-empty values into the tree, the most significant element of the key is used to identify the corresponding leaf. All key-value pairs that map to a given leaf are inserted (ordered) in the leaf.

The following procedures are available to read data from and make updates to a Sparse Merkle Tree.

| Procedure   | Description   |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| get         | Returns the value located under the specified key in the Sparse Merkle Tree defined by the specified root.<br/><br/>If no values had been previously inserted under the specified key, an empty word is returned.<br/><br/>**Inputs:** `[KEY, ROOT, ...]`<br/>**Outputs:** `[VALUE, ROOT, ...]`<br/><br/>Fails if the tree with the specified root does not exist in the VM's advice provider. |
| set         | Inserts the specified value under the specified key in a Sparse Merkle Tree defined by the specified root. If the insert is successful, the old value located under the specified key is returned via the stack.<br/><br/>If `VALUE` is an empty word, the new state of the tree is guaranteed to be equivalent to the state as if the updated value was never inserted.<br/><br/>**Inputs:** `[VALUE, KEY, ROOT, ...]`<br/>**Outputs:** `[OLD_VALUE, NEW_ROOT, ...]`<br/><br/>Fails if the tree with the specified root does not exits in the VM's advice provider. |
| peek        | Emits the `miden::core::collections::smt::smt_peek` event, which pushes onto the advice stack the value associated with the specified key in a Sparse Merkle Tree defined by the specified root.<br/><br/>If no values had been previously inserted under the specified key, an empty word is returned.<br/><br/>**Inputs:**<ul><li>Operand stack: `[KEY, ROOT, ...]`</li><li>Advice stack: `[]`</li></ul><br/>**Outputs:**<ul><li>Operand stack: `[KEY, ROOT, ...]`</li><li>Advice stack: `[VALUE]`</li></ul><br/>Fails if the tree with the specified root does not exist in the VM's advice provider. |

## Sorted Array

Module `miden::core::collections::sorted_array` contains procedures for searching in sorted arrays of words. These procedures use non-deterministic advice to efficiently find values or keys in sorted data structures.

The following procedures are available:

| Procedure          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| find_word          | Finds a value in a sorted array of words.<br/><br/>**Inputs:** `[VALUE, start_ptr, end_ptr, ...]`<br/>**Outputs:** `[is_value_found, value_ptr, start_ptr, end_ptr, ...]`<br/><br/>Where `VALUE` is the word to search for, `start_ptr` and `end_ptr` define the array bounds (word-aligned), `is_value_found` is 1 if found and 0 otherwise, and `value_ptr` points to the found value or the insertion point.<br/><br/>**Requirements:**<br/>- Words must be sorted in non-decreasing order<br/>- `start_ptr` and `end_ptr` must be word-aligned<br/>- `start_ptr <= end_ptr`<br/><br/>**Cycles:** 25-286 depending on case |
| find_key_value     | Finds a key in a sorted array of (key, value) word tuples.<br/><br/>**Inputs:** `[KEY, start_ptr, end_ptr, ...]`<br/>**Outputs:** `[is_key_found, key_ptr, start_ptr, end_ptr, ...]`<br/><br/>Where `KEY` is the 4-element key to search for. The array contains pairs of words where each pair is (key, value).<br/><br/>**Requirements:**<br/>- Keys must be sorted in non-decreasing order<br/>- `start_ptr` must be word-aligned<br/>- `(end_ptr - start_ptr)` must be divisible by 8 (double-word aligned)<br/>- `start_ptr <= end_ptr`<br/><br/>**Cycles:** 25-322 depending on case |
| find_half_key_value | Finds a half-key in a sorted array of (key, value) word tuples. Only the two most significant elements of the key need to match.<br/><br/>**Inputs:** `[key_suffix, key_prefix, start_ptr, end_ptr, ...]`<br/>**Outputs:** `[is_key_found, key_ptr, start_ptr, end_ptr, ...]`<br/><br/>Where `key_prefix` is the most significant element and `key_suffix` is the second most significant element of the key to match.<br/><br/>Same requirements as `find_key_value`. |

// ================================================================================================

/// Bundles the common state threaded through all execution functions.

/// passing node references (obtained from the forest) alongside `&mut ExecutionState` to
/// functions, since both would borrow the same struct.

// MAIN EXECUTION FUNCTION
// ================================================================================================

/// Executes the main execution loop given an abstract processor until a break condition is met.
///
/// By "main execution loop", we mean the loop that fetches the top continuation from the provided
/// continuation stack, executes it (possibly pushing new continuations onto the stack), and checks
/// the stopper after each clock cycle to see whether execution should stop. Execution is complete
/// when `ControlFlow::Continue` is returned, at which point the implementing processor can inspect
/// the final state of the processor and/or tracer.
///
/// # Tracing
///
/// Different processor implementations will need to record different pieces of information as the
/// the program is executed. For example, the [`crate::FastProcessor::execute_trace_inputs`]
/// execution mode needs to build a [`crate::TraceGenerationContext`] which records information
/// necessary to build the trace at each clock cycle, while the
/// [`crate::parallel::core_trace_fragment::CoreTraceFragmentFiller`] needs to build the trace
/// essentially by recording the processor state at each clock cycle. For this purpose, the
/// [`Self::execute_impl`] method takes in [`Tracer`] argument that abstracts away the "information
/// recording" logic (or "tracing") for each processor implementation. Note that the same processor
/// implementation is also free to use different tracers for different execution modes.
///
/// # Stopping
///
/// Execution can be stopped at any clock cycle based on user-defined conditions. For this purpose,
/// the [`Self::execute_impl`] method takes in a [`Stopper`] argument that is queried after each
/// clock cycle to determine whether execution should stop. This is useful for implementing stepping
/// modes (e.g., step-by-step execution), or executing a predetermined number of clock cycles (e.g.,
/// in trace generation, where separate trace fragments are generated concurrently).
///
/// # Sans-IO
///
/// In addition to the stopper, execution can also be interrupted by operations that may require
/// asynchronous execution outside of the main loop. We refer to this general pattern as "sans-IO".
/// Each such operation has their own [`InternalBreakReason`] enum variant, and a corresponding
/// "finish" function (e.g., [`finish_emit_op_execution`] for the `Emit` break reason) that must be
/// called to complete the execution of the operation after the main loop has been interrupted, and
/// before calling [`Self::execute_impl`] again.
///
/// In pseudo-code, the general pattern when implementing program execution in a processor is as
/// follows:
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut continuation_stack = ...;
/// let mut current_forest = ...;
/// let kernel = ...;
/// let mut host = ...;
/// let mut tracer = ...;
/// let stopper = ...;
///
/// while let ControlFlow::Break(internal_break_reason) = self.execute_impl() {
///     match internal_break_reason {
///         InternalBreakReason::User(reason) => {
///             // Handle user-initiated break (e.g., propagate break reason)
///         },
///         InternalBreakReason::Emit { basic_block_node_id, op_idx, continuation } => {
///             // Handle Emit operation (e.g., call `SyncHost::on_event`)
///             self.op_emit(...);
///    
///             // As per `InternalBreakReason::Emit` documentation, we call `finish_emit_op_execution`
///             // to complete the execution of the Emit operation.
///             finish_emit_op_execution(...);
///         },

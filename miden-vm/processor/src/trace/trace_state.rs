/// 1. core trace state: the state of the processor at any clock cycle in the fragment, initialized
///    to the state at the first clock cycle in the fragment,
/// 2. execution replay: information needed to replay the execution of the processor for the
///    remainder of the fragment,
/// 3. continuation: a stack of continuations for the processor representing the nodes in the MAST
///    forest to execute when the current node is done executing,
/// 4. initial MAST forest: the MAST forest being executed at the start of the fragment (which can
///    change during execution when encountering an [`miden_core::mast::ExternalNode`] or

// TRACER TRAIT
// ================================================================================================

/// A trait for tracing the execution of a processor.
///
/// Allows for recording different aspects of the processor's execution. For example, the
/// [`crate::FastProcessor::execute_trace_inputs`] execution mode needs to build a
/// [`crate::TraceGenerationContext`] which records information necessary to build the trace at each
/// clock cycle.
///
/// A useful mental model to differentiate between the processor and the tracer is:
/// - Processor: maintains and mutates the state of the VM components (system, stack, memory, etc)
///   as execution progresses
/// - Tracer: records auxiliary information *derived from* the processor state
///
/// # Methods overview
///
/// The main methods of this trait are [`start_clock_cycle`] and [`finalize_clock_cycle`], which are
/// called at the start and end of each clock cycle, respectively. These methods are the only
/// methods for which a reference to the processor is passed in, due to the fact that the state that
/// the processor is in at that point is completely unambiguous (i.e. either before all mutations
/// for the clock cycle, or after all mutations except the clock register for the clock cycle).
///
/// We refer to all other methods as "in-cycle methods". These methods are called at some point
/// during the execution of the clock cycle, with the following guarantee:
///
/// *At most one in-cycle method is called between [`start_clock_cycle`] and
/// [`finalize_clock_cycle`] for each clock cycle.*
///
/// This guarantee is designed to prevent implementations from relying on undocumented ordering
/// between in-cycle methods, which may be subject to change in future versions of the processor.
///
/// Note 1: The only exception to the above rule is the method [`record_mast_forest_resolution`],
/// which is called at the point of resolving a MAST forest (i.e. when execution encounters an
/// external node or a dyn node with an unknown callee). This method is special in that we expect
/// implementations to simply record the resolved MAST forest, without performing any other logic
/// that depends on the timing of the call.
///
/// Note 2: The in-cycle methods are included in the trait for performance reasons; technically,
/// implementations *could* only use [`start_clock_cycle`] and [`finalize_clock_cycle`] to record
/// any auxiliary information they need by accessing the processor state before or after each clock
/// cycle. However, experiments show that this requires redoing too much work in the tracer already
/// performed by the processor, which degrades performance.
pub trait Tracer {
    type Processor;

    /// Signals the start of a new clock cycle, guaranteed to be called at the start of the clock
    /// cycle, before any mutations to the processor state is made. For example, it is safe to
    /// access the processor's stack and memory state as they are before executing the operation at
    /// the current clock cycle.
    ///
    /// `continuation` represents what is to be executed at the beginning of this clock cycle, while
    /// `continuation_stack` represents whatever comes after executing `continuation`.
    ///
    /// The following continuations do not occur at the start of a clock cycle, and hence will never
    /// be passed to this method:
    /// - Continuation::FinishExternal: because external nodes are resolved before starting a clock
    ///   cycle,
    /// - Continuation::EnterForest: because entering a new forest does not consume a clock cycle,
    /// - Continuation::AfterExitDecorators and Continuation::AfterExitDecoratorsBasicBlock: because
    ///   after-exit decorators are executed at the end of an `END` operation; never at the start of
    ///   a clock cycle

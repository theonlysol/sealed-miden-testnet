# Lifted STARK Prover

End-to-end proving for the lifted STARK protocol using LMCS commitments
and the lifted FRI PCS. Supports multiple traces of different power-of-two
heights via virtual lifting.

Protocol-level overview lives in `miden-lifted-stark/README.md`.

## Entry Points

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `prove_single` | Prove a single-AIR STARK |
| `prove_multi` | Prove a multi-trace STARK |
| `AirWitness` | Bundle a trace with its public values |

```text
prove_single(config, air, trace, public_values, var_len_public_inputs, aux_builder, challenger)
prove_multi(config, &[(air, witness, aux_builder), ...], challenger)
```

The proof is written into the provided transcript channel. This crate does not
prescribe the *initial* challenger state used for Fiat-Shamir.

## Fiat-Shamir / transcript binding

The caller must bind protocol parameters, public values, variable-length
public inputs, AIR configurations, and `air_order` into the challenger
before calling `prove_multi`. See the Rust module-level docs for the full contract
and code examples.

## Protocol flow

1. Validate trace dimensions against AIR definition.
2. Commit main trace LDE on nested coset (bit-reversed), observe commitment.
3. Sample aux randomness, build aux trace, commit aux LDE.
4. Sample constraint folding challenge `alpha` and cross-trace accumulator `beta`.
5. Build periodic LDEs for periodic columns.
6. Compute folded constraint numerators on each trace's quotient domain `gJ`.
7. Lift and beta-accumulate numerators onto the max quotient domain.
8. Divide by the max vanishing polynomial to obtain Q(gJ).
9. Commit quotient chunks via fused iDFT + scaling + DFT pipeline.
10. Sample OOD point `z` (rejection-sampled outside trace domain), derive `z_next`.
11. Open via PCS at `[z, z_next]` for main, aux, and quotient trees.

## Mathematical background

This section assumes familiarity with classic STARKs and focuses on what
changes with **lifting** — how the prover avoids work on the largest
("lifted") domains. All sizes are powers of two.

### Domains and cosets

Let:

- $N = 2^n$ be the **maximum** trace height across all traces in the proof.
- $D = 2^d$ be the **constraint degree** (quotient-domain blowup).
- $B = 2^b$ be the **PCS/FRI blowup** (commitment-domain blowup), with $D \le B$.
- $g$ be the fixed multiplicative shift (`F::GENERATOR`).

Define two-adic subgroups:

$$
H = \langle \omega_H \rangle,\ |H| = N
\qquad
J = \langle \omega_J \rangle,\ |J| = N\,D
\qquad
K = \langle \omega_K \rangle,\ |K| = N\,B
$$

with the usual relationships:

$$
\omega_H = \omega_J^D = \omega_K^B
\qquad
H = J^D = K^B
\qquad
J = K^{B/D}\ \text{(when } D \le B\text{)}
$$

We work over shifted cosets $gH, gJ, gK$.

### Mixed heights via lifting

Suppose trace $T_j$ has height

$$
n_j = N / r_j
\qquad\text{where } r_j = 2^{\ell_j} \text{ is a power of two.}
$$

Intuitively, **lifting** makes $T_j$ look like a height-$N$ trace by stacking $r_j$
copies of it. Algebraically, if $t_j(X)$ is the degree-$<n_j$ interpolant over $H^{r_j}$,
the *lifted* polynomial is

$$
t_j^*(X) = t_j(X^{r_j}),
$$

which has degree $< N$.

The key map is the projection

$$
\pi_{r}(X) = X^{r}.
$$

It maps max-size domains onto smaller ones:

$$
\pi_{r_j}(H) = H^{r_j} \quad\text{and}\quad \pi_{r_j}(gK) = (gK)^{r_j} = g^{r_j} K^{r_j}.
$$

#### Commitment domains: nested cosets without extra LDE work

For each trace $T_j$, the prover commits to its LDE evaluations on the **nested**
coset $(gK)^{r_j}$ (size $n_j B$), not on the full $gK$ (size $N B$).

Concretely, `commit_traces` chooses the per-trace coset shift

$$
\text{shift}_j = g^{r_j},
$$

so that evaluating on $\text{shift}_j \cdot K^{r_j}$ matches the image of $gK$
under $X \mapsto X^{r_j}$. This is the core "no work on the lifted domain" win:
computing an LDE for a short trace stays $\Theta(n_j B)$, not $\Theta(N B)$.

### Quotient-domain constraint evaluation

As in a classic STARK, constraints produce a numerator polynomial divisible by the
trace vanishing polynomial. The twist is **where** we evaluate it.

Let $Q(X)$ be the quotient we will ultimately commit. Its degree bound is controlled
by the AIR's constraint degree $D$, so it suffices to evaluate the constraint numerator
on the **quotient coset** $gJ$ (size $N D$) rather than on the full LDE coset $gK$
(size $N B$).

Implementation-wise:

- The committed trace LDEs are stored on $gK$ in **bit-reversed** row order.
- The quotient domain $gJ$ is the first $N D$ points of $gK$ under this ordering.
- Therefore we obtain a zero-copy natural-order view of trace values on $gJ$ by
  truncating to $N D$ rows and bit-reversing. This is what
  `Committed::evals_on_quotient_domain` encodes.

### Lifting numerators instead of re-evaluating constraints

The expensive part of proving is evaluating constraints across a domain.
For a short trace $T_j$ we do **not** evaluate constraints over the max domain.

Instead:

1. Evaluate the folded constraint numerator $N_j$ on the *small* quotient coset
   $(gJ)^{r_j}$ of size $n_j D$.

2. **Lift** $N_j$ onto the max quotient coset $gJ$ by cyclic extension:

$$
\big(\mathrm{lift}_{r}(v)\big)\lbrack i\rbrack = v\lbrack i \bmod |v|\rbrack,\quad i \in \lbrack 0, r\,|v|).
$$

This matches $X \mapsto X^{r}$ on two-adic cosets: iterating the $gJ$ points
in natural order, raising them to the $r$-th power cycles through $(gJ)^r$ with period
$| (gJ)^r |$.

3. Combine lifted numerators across traces using challenge $\beta$ (Horner):

$$
N_{\mathrm{acc}} \leftarrow \mathrm{lift}_{r}(N_{\mathrm{acc}}) \cdot \beta + N_j.
$$

Because $Z_{H^{r_j}}(X^{r_j}) = Z_H(X)$, lifting turns "divisible by $Z_{H^{r_j}}$" into
"divisible by $Z_H$". After combining, the result is still divisible by $Z_H$,
so we divide **once** on the max domain.

### Vanishing division (periodicity trick)

On $gJ$, the vanishing polynomial

$$
Z_H(X) = X^N - 1
$$

takes only $D$ distinct values, since for $x = g\,\omega_J^i$:

$$
x^N = g^N\,(\omega_J^N)^i = g^N\,\omega_S^i
\qquad\text{where } \omega_S := \omega_J^N \text{ has order } D.
$$

Division by $Z_H$ batch-inverts those $D$ values once and indexes by
$i \bmod D$ (a bitmask in code).

### Quotient commitment (fused scaling)

After division we have $Q$ evaluated on $gJ$ in natural order. We commit to
LDE evaluations of the $D$ degree-$<N$ chunks $q_0,\dots,q_{D-1}$ on $gK$.

The decomposition: $gJ$ splits into $D$ disjoint $H$-cosets,

$$
gJ = \bigsqcup_{t=0}^{D-1} g\,\omega_J^t\,H,
$$

and $q_t$ is the unique degree-$<N$ polynomial agreeing with $Q$ on
$g\,\omega_J^t\,H$.

The `commit_quotient` pipeline computes LDE commitments via fused scaling:

1. Reshape $Q(gJ)$ into an $N \times D$ matrix; column $t$ is $Q$ on
   $g\,\omega_J^t\,H$.
2. Batched iDFT over $H$ (treating each column as if on $H$), yielding
   coefficients with an extra $(g\,\omega_J^t)^k$ factor.
3. Multiply row $k$, column $t$ by $(\omega_J^t)^{-k}$ so coefficients become
   "$g^k$-shifted but $t$-independent".
4. Zero-pad from $N$ to $N B$ and run a plain (non-coset) DFT. The $g^k$
   factor baked into coefficients produces evaluations on $gK$.

This avoids $D$ separate coset DFTs and aligns with how the verifier
reconstructs $Q(z)$ from the opened chunk values.
